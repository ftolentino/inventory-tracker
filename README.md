# Local Business Inventory Tracker

## By *_Filmer Tolentino_*

## _Description_
----------
_Build an application in React that tracks inventory for a local business. We're going to keep this simple: you'll pick one inventory item and track how much of it is remaining as it gets sold or given away. There are a lot of themes to choose from, and you can create your own as long as you're able to track the remaining amount of an inventory item and meet the objectives._

_For the purposes of explaining requirements, we'll stick to the theme of a coffee shop that sells coffee beans. Scroll down to see other theme ideas._

_At our coffee shop, we sell coffee beans in 1-pound servings, and we get our coffee delivered in large burlap sacks. Here are the details:_

_we sell multiple types of coffee beans, each in different burlap sacks one burlap sack contains 130 pounds of coffee beans every sale decrements one pound of coffee beans from the burlap sack, until it is empty_

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
